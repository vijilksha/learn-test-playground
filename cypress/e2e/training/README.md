### 2. Advanced POM - `02-advanced-pom.cy.js`
Advanced POM with getters, actions, and assertions
- JavaScript getters (no parentheses)
- Method chaining with 'return this'
- Organized structure (locators, actions, assertions)

### 3. Fixtures - `03-fixtures.cy.js`
Managing test data with JSON fixtures
- Three ways to load fixtures
- Working with multiple fixtures
- Accessing fixture data in tests

### 4. Custom Commands - `04-custom-commands.cy.js`

Key differences between Cypress and Selenium
- Why const a = cy.get() doesn't work
- Proper .then() usage
- Automatic waiting
- Command chaining

## Quick Start

```bash

# Run specific test
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/training/01-basic-pom.cy.js"

# Open Cypress UI
npx cypress open
```
